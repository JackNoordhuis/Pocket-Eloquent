### About

Pocket Eloquent is a [poggit virion](https://github.com/poggit/support/blob/master/virion.md) for use in [PocketMine-MP](https://github.com/pmmp/PocketMine-MP)
plugins that gives plugin developers access to the [Eloquent ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/5.6/eloquent) through the
[laravel database](https://laravel.com/docs/5.6/database) components.

Currently only the Eloquent ORM and database migrations are implemented, you can view basic implementation of these components in the [example plugin](https://github.com/JackNoordhuis/Pocket-Eloquent/tree/master/examples/ReturningPlayer) provided.

This project is still under heavy development and API methods are subject to change at any time without notice.
